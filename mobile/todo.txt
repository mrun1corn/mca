Mobile App TODO — Parity + Polish

High Priority
1) Icons (tabs + inline)
   - Integrate icons without Expo plugin regressions.
   - Approach: use react-native-vector-icons (non-Expo), add fonts to Android, wire tabBarIcon.
   - Files: mobile/src/navigation/tabs.tsx, android/app/build.gradle (fonts), android/app/src/main/assets/fonts/ (if needed).

2) Dark Theme Sweep
   - Replace defaultProps hack with theme-aware primitives: ThemeText, ThemeInput, ThemedCard.
   - Audit screens for consistent text, placeholder, border colors in light/dark.
   - Files: mobile/src/theme.tsx, create mobile/src/components/ui/{ThemeText.tsx,ThemeInput.tsx,ThemedCard.tsx}.
   - Screens to sweep: Login, People, ExportCsv, Setup, Deposit, Withdraw, Home, MemberDrawer.

3) Home — Users Card Styling
   - Match web layout: spacing, font sizes, and information hierarchy on cards.
   - Add subtle press feedback; consistent two-column grid.
   - Files: mobile/src/screens/Home.tsx, mobile/src/components/Card.tsx

4) Member Drawer Polish
   - Apply theme colors for all rows; add dividers and consistent paddings.
   - Ensure amounts use success/danger colors, dates dimmed.
   - Files: mobile/src/components/MemberDrawer.tsx

5) Withdraw — Exclude UX
   - Ensure taker is excluded (read-only); chips have clear active/inactive states.
   - Submission uses final exclusion set; align labels to web wording.
   - Files: mobile/src/screens/Withdraw.tsx

6) Deposit — Selector + Pay Due
   - Refine dropdown sizing/chevron alignment; consistent placeholder styling.
   - Show Pay Due only when member has open dues (current behavior) and keep penalty options gated to Pay Due.
   - Files: mobile/src/components/UserSelect.tsx, mobile/src/screens/Deposit.tsx

Medium Priority
7) Input/Placeholder Consistency
   - Unify input paddings, borders, and placeholder text across all screens.
   - Files: all screens with inputs.

8) Animations
   - Add light ripple/scale on card taps and list rows; consistent button feedback.
   - Files: shared small animation helpers; update screens where interaction exists.

9) Error/Toast Feedback
   - Show friendly toast on auth/network errors; indicate success on actions.
   - Files: reusable Toast hook/component; wire in Login/Deposit/Withdraw.

Environment/Build
10) HTTPS for Production
   - Point EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE to https in production.
   - Optionally disable cleartextTraffic in release manifest or gate it by build variant.
   - Files: mobile/.env (prod), android manifest security config.

11) CI Build
   - Add EAS or GitHub Actions workflow to build release APK/AAB and attach artifacts.
