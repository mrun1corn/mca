Mobile App TODO — Next Iteration

✅ Wrapped up
- Icons via `react-native-vector-icons` wired into tabs/buttons.
- Theming components (`ThemeText`, `ThemeInput`, `ThemedCard`) applied across screens.
- Member drawer + exclude chips polished; penalty options gated; hook-order issue fixed.
- Logout flow & one-time login implemented.

Focus Areas
1) Offline Cache & Queue
   - Persist home/me/dues/transactions queries (SQLite or MMKV).
   - Queue mutate actions (deposit, withdraw) for background replay.

2) Feedback & Observability
   - Toast/sheet component for success/error messages (reuse across screens).
   - Capture API failures with context logging (Sentry or custom endpoint).

3) Accessibility & UX
   - Larger tap targets for chips/buttons, add VoiceOver labels.
   - Support dynamic type via responsive typography tokens.

4) Testing
   - Add Jest + RNTL coverage for auth flow, role gating, dues calculations.
   - Wire detox/E2E smoke to ensure tab layout + navigation works post-build.

5) Release Pipeline
   - Configure EAS Build profiles (`preview`, `production`) with managed signing.
   - Automate version bumping + changelog generation.
